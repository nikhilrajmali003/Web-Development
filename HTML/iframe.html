<p>Just like the growing human population has become a threat to the environment. Global warming is a major threat to the environment. The atmosphere and hydrosphere, on the other hand, are components of the environment that have an impact on the lives of living things. The atmosphere contains gases like oxygen and nitrogen. Every living being is developed according to the characteristics of these components. Aquatic species, for example, are designed to breathe underwater. Aerial animals are designed to live in the air. So even the tiniest change in natureâ€™s subtle balance makes it difficult for living organisms to survive in the environment it is designed to live in.
